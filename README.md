I have modified code that we have done in class 
In HTML i have changed filter buttons by adding the <div> with buttons to filters tasks on therir 
Status:ALL,Completed and Pending.

And in CSS i have changed filter buttons by adding the filter-container: Centered layout with
spacing between buttons. 
filter-btn: Added padding, background color, hover effects, and border-radius for visual appeal.

In javascript i have updated the local storage handling: Tasks now persist across page reloads.
Each task includes a completed status for better management.

SaveTaskToLocalStorage: Saves tasks presistently.
RemoveTaskFromLocalStorage: Updates task statuses.

Filter Functionality
all:Shows all taska.
Completed:Displays only completed tasks.
pending:Displays only incomplete tasks.

user interactions
Double-click task allows editing prompt.
Click task toggles its completion status.
